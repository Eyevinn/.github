Glad you found our little spot on Internet!

We are [Eyevinn Technology](https://www.eyevinntechology.se), and we are vendor independent video developer specialists working with many areas of the video delivery chain. As our way to innovate and push the industry forward we develop proof-of-concepts and tools. The things we learn and the code we write we share with the industry in [blogs](https://dev.to/video) and by open sourcing the code we have written.

**And, this is what you will find here!**

If you fancy any help in hosting, enhancing or integrating any of the components you find here just drop an email to sales@eyevinn.se and we'll figure something out together.
